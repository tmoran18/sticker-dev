# Sticker Dev

This site was a great idea I had one day. I was trying to break into the industry somehow, so I built an e-commerce website to sell developer type laptop stickers.
I got a couple of thousand stickers printed up for cheap from an old printing boss of mine, while building the site out. I then got together 40 free packs
of stickers together and sent them out to 40 different software companies around Brisbane that I was interested in working for, directing them back to the site
to see what I'm all about.

Low and behold I scored an interview from one of the companies, who ended up hiring me. I the end I sold 1 pack of stickers.... to one of my friends, but I scored my
first developer job, which made it all worth the time and money I spent on it.

The site is now retired, but you can check out the code, and images below.
